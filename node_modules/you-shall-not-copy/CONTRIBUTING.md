## ‚úçÔ∏è how to contribute (actually this is a private GitHub repository)

1. Clone the you-shall-not-copy repository locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daniepa/you-shall-not-copy.git
```

2. Switch from master to **develop** branch

3. Create new local branch in order to handle/solve an issue.

4. Test the fix: in another VSC window create your test React project with Vite and install you-shall-not-copy:<br/>
Instead of **local_path_ysnc** insert the local path where you cloned ysnc (in the previous step)

```bash
npm install local_path_ysnc
```
for example:
```bash
npm install C:\projects\test\ysnc
```
Now the CLI is in your React project and you can test your mod!
