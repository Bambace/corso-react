# you-shall-not-copy 🧙‍♂️
Gandalf **helps developers create React folders and components** without the hassle of copy-pasting.
**ysnc** is a CLI tool developed in JavaScript, designed for React Developers who want speed up their workflow.

---

## 🚀 project goals 
- With **ysnc**, you just provide the component name, and the tool will handle the rest:
    - create the `src/component` folder (if not present)
    - create the component folder(s) 
    - Add the `.jsx` file (with a boilerplate)
    - Add the `.css` file. 

## 📦 How it works? Simple!
1. open your React project with VS Code and install **you-shall-not-copy** from **npm** as dev dependency:

```bash
npm i you-shall-not-copy -D
```

2. Want to create `Button` component? Just type: 
```bash
npx ysnc Button
```
this will create the `components` folder (if not exists), `Button` folder isnide it, and add both `Button.jsx` (with poilerplate) and `Button.css`.

3. Need multiple components like `Header`, `Section` and `Image` components? Just type:
```bash
npx ysnc Header,Section,Image
```
and you'll get:
```bash
src/components/
├── Header/
│   ├── Header.jsx
│   └── Header.css
├── Section/
│   ├── Section.jsx
│   └── Section.css
└── Image/
    ├── Image.jsx
    └── Image.css
```
